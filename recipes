    Healthier Baked Cheesecake
    Ingredients
        non-stick cooking spray
        4 eggs, separated, plus 2 egg whites
        sugar substitute equal to 3/4 cup sugar, divided
        1 teaspoon lemon juice, divided
        dash of salt
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        3 cups 3% soft white cheese, or light cream cheese or ricotta cheese, drained
        1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
        2 tablespoons vanilla-flavored, low-carb soy protein powder
        Topping:
        1/2 cup low-fat sour cream
        sugar substitute equal to 2 tablespoons sugar
        1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
    Directions
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with baking paper.
        Spray just a bit with non-stick cooking spray. Separate the eggs. Beat egg whites with salt,
        half of the sugar substitute and half of the lemon juice, until stiff.
        Beat the egg yolks with the remaining sugar substitute until thick. With the mixer on a low-medium setting,
        beat in the vanilla, cheese, lemon juice and rind, and protein powder until incorporated. Gently fold into the beaten egg whites.
        Bake for 10 minutes at 400F, then turn the oven down to 300F and bake for another 40 minutes.
        When the top of the cake is set, turn off the oven and keep the oven door closed.
        Allow to cool for another hour in the oven. Remove and continue to cool on a wire rack.
        Combine topping ingredients. Spread on top of the cheesecake and bake for 5 minutes at 450F.

        Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Mix until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips.
        Grease two loaf pans and pour half the batter into each. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 30-40 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.

    Greek Quinoa Salad
    Ingredients
        2 cups cooked tricolor quinoa (1 cup raw)
        2 small cucumbers
        10-15 cherry tomatoes
        1 small purple onion
        1 cup loosely packed flat leaf parsley
        1 cup pitted black olives (use kalamata if you have)
        1 cup cooked or canned chickpeas
        1 cup crumbled feta cheese
        ¼ cup olive oil
        ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
        2 tbsp. red wine vinegar
        2 cloves garlic
        1 tsp. salt
        ½ tsp. fresh cracked black pepper
    Directions
        Cook the quinoa according to the directions on the packet and set aside to cool fully.
        (You can use any kind of quinoa—I like the look and texture of the tri-color.)
        Prepare the vegetables: slice the cucumbers into quarter rounds, halve or quarter the tomatoes (depending on size),
        finely dice the onion, chop the parsley roughly, and slice the olives. If you’re using canned chickpeas, rinse them thoroughly.
        Whisk the dressing ingredients in a small bowl.
        Gently toss the quinoa with the vegetables and feta. Pour the dressing and toss until coated. Serve.
